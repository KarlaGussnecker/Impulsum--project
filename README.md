## Regrets

The initial request for this project was the usage of the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependecies. However, after many struggles I came to the conclusion that I will not be able to integrate them correctly in the code :anger:. I mainly ended up using the ChakraUI libraries in order to deliver a similiar result, but I would love to learn more about the above dependecies so I will be continuing with my research.
<br/>
I also would have loved to migrate the existing code to TypeScript with [ts-migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-migrate) but that as well has proven to be a impossible challenge that I decided to conquer some other time in the near future.
